# HackSploit

This is a very simple Helm chart deployment that sets a secret in the default namespace of a Kubernetes cluster with
a created ServiceAccount token. This is an extremely benign attack designed to demonstrate the increased probability (or lack thereof) 
of an attack when running a Kubernetes cluster.

This is a simple repo, I will likely not be updating.
